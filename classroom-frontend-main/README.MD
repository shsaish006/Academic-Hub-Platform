## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

A high-performance PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) academic hub. This multi-role system (Admin, Teacher, Student) utilizes a decoupled architecture where an Express/Node.js backend serves a modular React frontend powered by Refine. By leveraging PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM, it ensures type-safe data integrity for class management, automated scheduling, and real-time analytics. Secure access is managed via Better-Auth, providing a robust, controlled-access environment for campus operations.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

### Frontend Stack

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** is a declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of complex, interactive UIs through reusable components, providing the core frontend experience for the academic hub.

- **[Refine](https://jsm.dev/pern-refine)** is a React-based framework for building data-intensive applications like admin panels and dashboards. It provides a headless approach that handles core logic—such as authentication, routing, and data fetching—allowing developers to focus on the UI and business logic.

- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** is a collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It allows developers to build high-quality, accessible design systems by providing beautifully designed components that can be copied and pasted directly into applications.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML, ensuring highly maintainable and responsive styling.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers. It is ideal for building large-scale applications and enhances the development experience.

- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)** is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It is used to define data structures and validate them at runtime, ensuring type safety and reducing bugs by providing a single source of truth for both static types and data validation.


### Backend Stack

- **[Arcjet](https://jsm.dev/pern-arcjet)** is a security-first tool that helps developers protect their applications with just a few lines of code. It provides security primitives for rate limiting, bot protection, email validation, and sensitive data masking, ensuring the application remains secure and resilient.

- **[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)** is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization library for TypeScript. It provides built-in support for email and password authentication, social sign-on (Google, GitHub, Apple, and more), and multi-factor authentication, simplifying user authentication and account management.

- **[Cloudinary](https://jsm.dev/pern-cloudinary)** is an end-to-end image and video management solution. It automates the upload, storage, manipulation, and delivery of media assets, ensuring optimized performance and a seamless visual experience across any device.

- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview)** is a lightweight and performant TypeScript ORM designed with developer experience in mind. It provides a seamless interface between application code and database operations while maintaining high performance and reliability.

- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of RESTful APIs and serves as the standard server framework for the Node.js ecosystem.

- **[Neon](https://neon.com/)** is a fully managed, serverless PostgreSQL database platform. It offers features like instant provisioning, autoscaling, and database branching, enabling developers to build scalable applications without managing infrastructure.

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It is designed to build scalable network applications and serves as the foundation for the project's backend logic.

### Dev Tools
- **[CodeRabbit](https://jsm.dev/pern-coderabbit)** is an AI-powered code review platform that provides automated, contextual feedback on pull requests. It helps developers improve code quality and catch potential bugs early by integrating directly into the development workflow.

- **[Site24x7](https://jsm.dev/pern-site24x7)** is a comprehensive monitoring solution that provides deep insights into application performance and infrastructure health. It allows for real-time tracking of uptime, end-user experience, and server metrics to ensure maximum availability.


## <a name="features">🔋 Features</a>

👉 **Multi-Role Authentication**: A secure entry system powered by **Better Auth** and **Arcjet** that dynamically routes Students, Teachers, and Admins to protected dashboards with strict role-based permissions.

👉 **Unified Analytics Dashboard**: A high-level overview of the institution's health, featuring real-time statistics on student enrollment, active classes, and faculty distribution via **Refine's** data providers.

👉 **Intelligent Subject Management**: Centralized control for curriculum where you can create subjects, apply instant filters, and drill down into specific class assignments and teacher workloads.

👉 **Departmental Governance**: A structural management layer that organizes subjects and faculties into departments, providing detailed views of every student and educator within a specific academic branch.

👉 **Dynamic Faculty Directory**: A robust, paginated directory of all professors featuring advanced search by name or email, profile image hosting via **Cloudinary**, and full teaching schedule visibility.

👉 **Advanced Class Orchestration**: The core engine of the app built with **Drizzle ORM**, allowing Admins to schedule sessions, set capacity limits, and manage complex assignments of multiple teachers across different sections.

👉 **Code-Based Enrollment System**: A "Google Classroom" inspired workflow where students gain instant access to courses by entering a unique 6-8 digit joining code, ensuring a secure and controlled-access environment.

And many more, including code architecture and reusability.
